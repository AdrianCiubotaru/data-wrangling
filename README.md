# Data Wrangling
## Analyzing tweets from WeRateDogs

This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. The project's goal is to gather, asses and clean data from the WeRateDogs twitter channel and to create interesting visualisations based on it.<br>

The repository contains the following files:
- the Jupyter Notebook with the data wrangling effort
- an initial dirty data set (twitter-archive-enhanced.csv)
- a txt file containing relevant information from each tweet, with each tweet being one line 
- a data set containing image predictions from a neural network based on each tweet with a picture
- a clean data set, which is the result of the data wrangling efforts (twitter_archive_master.csv)
- an html file with documents the data wrangling effort (wrangle_report.html)
- an html file with the visualisations generated from the clean data set (act_report.html)
